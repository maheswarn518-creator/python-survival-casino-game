# python-survival-casino-game
A text-based survival casino game built in Python using OOP, NumPy, Pandas, and random modules.  Includes multiple mini-games (dice roll, coin flip, card draw, slots),  balance management, game history tracking, and an interactive story-driven flow.


🎲🍴 Casino & Restaurant Game — Project Description
🔹 Overview
This project is a Python-based interactive game that combines two experiences:

🚀 Features - 
🎰 **Casino mini-games** (slots, dice, etc.) 
- 🍽️ **Restaurant menu system** using Pandas DataFrames
- 🧩 **Modular OOP design** with inheritance and abstraction
-  🔢 **NumPy integration** for efficient array/matrix operations
- 🛠️ **Error handling & debugging** for smooth gameplay
- 
Casino mini-games (like slots or dice) for entertainment.

Restaurant menu management where players can browse, order, and manage food items.

The goal is to demonstrate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, while integrating NumPy for efficient numerical operations and Pandas for structured data handling.

🔹 Key Features
Casino Section

Mini-games built with modular classes (e.g., Slots, Dice).

Randomized outcomes using NumPy arrays for probability and fairness.

Clear win/lose logic with score tracking.

Restaurant Section

Menu stored and managed using Pandas DataFrames.

Players can view items, place orders, and calculate bills.

Easy extension for adding new dishes or categories.

Game Flow

Central main.py acts as the entry point.

Players choose between casino or restaurant activities.

Smooth navigation with input validation and error handling.

🔹 Technical Highlights
OOP Design

Classes for casino games, restaurant menus, and utilities.

Inheritance and abstraction to avoid code duplication.

Modular structure for scalability.

Libraries Used

NumPy → Random number generation, probability handling.

Pandas → Menu storage, order lookups, and bill calculations.

Best Practices

.gitignore to keep the repo clean.

requirements.txt for dependency management.

Unit tests for reliability.

🔹 Why This Project Matters
Shows ability to design modular systems using OOP.

Demonstrates data handling skills with Pandas and NumPy.

Reflects problem-solving and debugging persistence.

Can be extended into a larger portfolio project (adding more games, restaurant features, or even a GUI).
